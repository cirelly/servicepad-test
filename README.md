# Frontend Test - ServicePad

It consists of two sections, the logic test and the frontend test.


## Logic test

Follow the steps to run each logic test:

```bash
  cd LogicTests
```

1. In mathematics, the Fibonacci sequence or serie is the following infinite
sequence of natural numbers:
0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377,610,987,1597 ...
where f (0) = 0, f (1) = 1 and f (n) = f (n-1) + f (n-2).
Code a program (in javascript or typescript) that solves for any
number in the fibonacci series.

```bash
  node fibonacci.js
```

2. Given a given input text, Code a program (in javascript or typescript) that
displays the number of repetitions of each word.
Sample text: "Hi how are things? How are you?Are you a developer? I
am also a developer"

```bash
  node countWords.js
```

3. Code a program (in javascript or typescript) that displays the numbers from
1 to 100 on the screen, substituting the multiples of 3 for the word "fizz", the
multiples of 5 for "buzz" and the multiples of both, that is, the multiples of 3
and 5, by the word "fizz buzz".

```bash
  node numbersFizzBuzz.js
```
