# Frontend Test - ServicePad

This is the resolution of a technical test sent by Servicepad for the position of Frontend Developer.
- The first part corresponds to a logical test where three algorithms described in the instructions section are solved to test these solutions.

- The second part of the test corresponds to replicating a mockup received by Servicepad, where ReactJS was used as the main work tool. An atomic architecture was implemented for the organization of components, scalability and reuse of components, BEMIT was implemented as a styling approach, which is a naming methodology to define the classes of the HTML nodes of our projects.

Below are the guidelines to reproduce each of the stages of this technical test:
## Demo

Here you can find a live demo of the application:
[Live Demo](https://servicepad-test.vercel.app/)


## Logic test

Follow the steps to run each logic test:

```bash
  cd LogicTests
```

1. In mathematics, the Fibonacci sequence or serie is the following infinite
sequence of natural numbers:
0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377,610,987,1597 ...
where f (0) = 0, f (1) = 1 and f (n) = f (n-1) + f (n-2).
Code a program (in javascript or typescript) that solves for any
number in the fibonacci series.

```bash
  node fibonacci.js
```

2. Given a given input text, Code a program (in javascript or typescript) that
displays the number of repetitions of each word.
Sample text: "Hi how are things? How are you?Are you a developer? I
am also a developer"

```bash
  node countWords.js
```

3. Code a program (in javascript or typescript) that displays the numbers from
1 to 100 on the screen, substituting the multiples of 3 for the word "fizz", the
multiples of 5 for "buzz" and the multiples of both, that is, the multiples of 3
and 5, by the word "fizz buzz".

```bash
  node numbersFizzBuzz.js
```
